# AGENTS.md

You are an expert React Native + Expo engineer helping build a production-quality AI study companion app.

You write clean, simple, maintainable code. You prioritize clarity over unnecessary abstraction because this app is used to teach developers how to build feature by feature.

You should think like a senior mobile developer, but explain and implement like someone building a practical learning project.

-----

## Project Overview

We are building **AI University Companion** — a calm, organized AI study partner that remembers a student's notes and answers questions using **only what they have saved**.

The app helps stressed, time-poor university students revise by turning their own material into a trustworthy study tool:

- add notes four ways — paste text, upload a file (PDF/doc), snap/scan a photo (AI reads it), or record class audio
- **Ask Questions ★** — a chat that answers **only from the student's own saved notes** and proves it with a "📌 From your notes" tag naming the source note
- a live **Memory Panel** showing every saved note — the visible proof the app remembers
- an **Auto-Quiz Generator** that turns notes into flashcards and multiple-choice questions
- **Deadline Reminders** for exam and assignment dates, colour-coded by urgency
- weak-topic tracking, streaks, and progress — the student improving over time
- beautiful mobile-first UI with full light and dark mode support

All intelligence flows through the **BTL Runtime** — Bad Theory Labs' OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, plus embeddings, retrieval & memory, tool use, and streaming). Notes are stored locally on the device as the source of truth; the runtime is used to embed, retrieve, and generate.

This is built for the **BTL Runtime Hackathon** on badtheorylabs.com — July 3–5, 2026. Every submission must call the BTL runtime.

### The single most important product idea

**Every answer the app gives must visibly come from a real note.** When the student sees a small "📌 From your notes" tag under an answer, they trust the app. That tag is the emotional core of the entire product. If the app cannot ground an answer in a saved note, it must say so honestly — never invent an answer.

### Product Pillars (what judges see on screen)

The design and the engineering must make each pillar visible. If a judge cannot see the pillar, we lose the point.

|Pillar        |What it means                    |How the app must show it                                            |
|--------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|🧠 Memory     |The app remembers saved notes    |A live **Memory Panel** where saved notes are always visible        |
|👁️ Attention  |It focuses on what matters       |Dashboard highlights **weak topics** & **upcoming deadlines**       |
|⚡ Action     |It does things for the student   |Obvious buttons: **Ask a Question**, **Generate Quiz**, **Add Reminder**|
|📈 Learning   |The student improves over time   |Progress bars, streaks, and a **topics mastered** view              |

### Design mood

Clean, modern, calm. Think **Notion + Duolingo**. One accent colour, lots of white space, rounded corners, soft shadows, and a confident **light + dark mode**. The interface must reduce exam anxiety, not add to it. Every screen answers one question instantly: *"what do I do next?"*

-----

## Hackathon Submission & Judging Rubric (ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND)

This is a **competition build for the BTL Runtime Hackathon**. Re-read this before starting any
feature and weigh every engineering/design decision against how it scores.

### What we must submit
- GitHub repo or public code link
- 2-minute demo video
- Short description of what we built
- **Which BTL runtime endpoint(s) we used** ← keep a running list as each one is wired
- Team name + member names

### 100-point rubric (optimize for this)

|Points|Criterion          |What it means for our build                                                                                                                                                     |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**30**|Use of BTL Runtime |The biggest lever. Route as many real jobs through the runtime as possible — grounded chat, vision OCR (scan), audio transcription (record), quiz generation, embeddings/retrieval. Breadth **and** depth of runtime use wins.|
|**25**|Usefulness         |Solve a real student pain end-to-end: notes in → trustworthy answers + quizzes + deadlines out. The "📌 From your notes" grounding is our usefulness proof.                        |
|**20**|Technical execution|Clean, working, no crashes. The RAG grounding gate actually works. Errors handled gracefully — never a raw stack trace.                                                          |
|**15**|Creativity         |The "answers only from your notes" trust mechanic + the note-flies-into-Memory moment.                                                                                           |
|**10**|Presentation       |Polished light-mode UI, calm design, a crisp 2-min demo hitting Ask + Scan + Record.                                                                                             |

### Tie-breakers (in order) — build toward these
1. **Stronger use of the BTL runtime** → use multiple endpoints and use them well (streaming, retrieval-gating, vision, audio).
2. **More complete working demo** → every advertised feature must actually run in the demo.
3. **Better real-world usefulness.**
4. **Clearer submission materials.**

### Standing implications for how we build
- Bias every "should we call AI here?" decision toward **yes, via the BTL runtime** — it is 30 pts plus the first tie-breaker.
- Keep a running list of BTL endpoints used (chat · vision · audio · embeddings) — it's a required submission field and the top score driver.
- Prioritize a **complete, crash-free demo path** over breadth of half-working features.
- Hero moments for the 2-min video: **Ask (grounded answer + tag)** and **Scan/Record (AI reads your material)**.

## Tech Stack

Use the following stack:

- Expo
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Expo Router
- NativeWind / Tailwind CSS
- Zustand
- AsyncStorage
- **BTL Runtime** — OpenAI-compatible gateway for all AI (chat, embeddings, retrieval, transcription, vision/OCR)
- SQLite (via `expo-sqlite`) for local note, chunk, deadline, and quiz storage
- `expo-document-picker` for file (PDF / doc) upload
- `expo-camera` + `expo-image-picker` for photo / scan (OCR)
- `expo-audio` for class-recording audio capture and waveform / PCM streaming
- `expo-notifications` for deadline reminders
- `@expo-google-fonts/inter` (or Plus Jakarta Sans) for the geometric-sans typeface

The BTL runtime is OpenAI-compatible, so the standard `openai` JS client (pointed at the BTL base URL) or plain `fetch` both work. Prefer a single thin client in `lib/btl.ts`.

Do not introduce new major libraries unless there is a strong reason. Always ask before installing.

-----

## Development Philosophy

Build feature by feature.

For every feature:

1. Understand the user request.
1. Check this file before coding.
1. Keep the implementation simple.
1. Avoid overengineering.
1. Prefer readable code over clever code.
1. Build the smallest useful version first.
1. Refactor only when repetition or complexity appears.
1. Keep the app easy to teach and explain.

-----

## Decision Making & Clarifications

If something is unclear or could be improved:

- Proactively suggest better approaches
- If a new library would significantly simplify implementation:
  - Recommend it
  - Explain why it is useful
  - Ask for permission before installing

Example:

> "This could be done manually, but react-native-reanimated would make the 'note flying into the Memory Panel' animation smoother. Do you want me to add it?"

Do not install or use new libraries without user approval.

### app/

Use this for routes and screens only.

Screens compose components and call hooks/stores. They do not contain large UI blocks or business logic.

#### Screen Reference

The bottom navigation has exactly **5 tabs**: HOME · ASK · MEMORY · QUIZ · DEADLINES — plus a central **+ Add Note** action button that launches the Add Note flow. There are **more than 7 screens**; the flows below break into sub-screens.

|Screen           |Route                     |Tab      |Description                                                                                     |

#### Navigation Structure

```
Bottom Tab Bar (exactly 5 tabs) + center Add button:
  HOME       — house icon
  ASK        — chat bubble icon
  [ + ]      — center Add Note button (raised accent circle) → add/index
  MEMORY     — brain / stack icon
  QUIZ       — cards icon
  DEADLINES  — calendar icon

Active tab:   theme accent colour icon + label + accent dot indicator below
Inactive tab: muted gray icon + gray label
Tab bar bg:   theme.bgPrimary

The Memory Panel may render as a persistent side panel on large screens (tablet/web),
but on phones it is a tab. Design the tab version first.
```

-----

## File Length & Component Extraction Rule (CRITICAL)

Screen files must not exceed **150 lines**.
Component files must not exceed **200 lines**.

If a screen file exceeds 150 lines, extract UI sections into `components/`.
If a component file exceeds 200 lines, split it into smaller sub-components.

Screen files only do three things:

1. Import components
1. Call hooks and stores
1. Compose the layout

Logic, styling, and animations belong in component files — never in screens.

Before writing any screen, **plan the component breakdown first**.
List which components you will create, build each one, then assemble the screen.

-----

## Light & Dark Mode System (CRITICAL)

AI University Companion supports both light and dark modes. This is a core product feature, not optional — students revise late at night before exams, so dark mode is essential.

### How theming works

1. `constants/colors.ts` exports both `lightColors` and `darkColors` objects
1. `store/useThemeStore.ts` tracks the user's theme preference ('light' | 'dark' | 'system')
1. `hooks/useTheme.ts` returns the correct color object based on current preference
1. Every component receives colors via `const colors = useTheme()`
1. **Never hardcode a hex color value inside a component or screen.** Always use `colors.X`

### useTheme hook

```ts
// hooks/useTheme.ts
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';
import { useThemeStore } from '@/store/useThemeStore';
import { lightColors, darkColors } from '@/constants/colors';

export const useTheme = () => {
  const systemScheme = useColorScheme();
  const { preference } = useThemeStore();
  const scheme = preference === 'system' ? systemScheme : preference;
  return scheme === 'dark' ? darkColors : lightColors;
};
```

### Color Tokens

> These are the **designer-brief starter tokens** (Notion + Duolingo feel, indigo accent). The final
> hackathon theme colours will be supplied later — when they arrive, change **only** `constants/colors.ts`.
> Because nothing else in the app hardcodes hex, re-theming is free.

```ts
// constants/colors.ts

export const lightColors = {
  // Backgrounds
  bgPrimary:    '#ffffff',   // Main screen background
  bgAlt:        '#f8f9fd',   // Alternate light background
  bgCard:       '#f6f7fc',   // Note / quiz / deadline card background
  bgCardInner:  '#eceef5',   // Inner / nested card background

  // Borders
  border:       '#e2e4ea',   // All card borders and dividers

  // Accent (indigo — one accent, used sparingly)
  accent:       '#5b5bd6',   // Primary buttons, links, highlights, the "From your notes" tag
  accentSoft:   '#ececfb',   // Selected states, accent backgrounds, tag background

  // Status
  success:      '#22c55e',   // Correct answers, mastered topics, streaks
  warning:      '#f59e0b',   // Soon-due deadlines, weak topics
  danger:       '#ef4444',   // This-week deadlines, failed topics, "wrong" feedback

  // Text
  textPrimary:  '#1a1a2e',   // Headings and body
  textSecondary:'#6b7280',   // Secondary text, timestamps
  textMuted:    '#a1a7b3',   // Dimmed — placeholders, inactive tabs

  // Tab bar
  tabActive:    '#1a1a2e',
  tabInactive:  '#a1a7b3',
  tabDot:       '#5b5bd6',
};

export const darkColors = {
  // Backgrounds
  bgPrimary:    '#14141f',   // Main screen background
  bgAlt:        '#0f0f18',   // Alternate dark background
  bgCard:       '#1e1e2e',   // Card background
  bgCardInner:  '#181826',   // Inner / nested card background

  // Borders
  border:       '#2a2a3a',   // All card borders and dividers

  // Accent (lifted indigo for dark-mode contrast)
  accent:       '#7c7cf0',   // Primary buttons, links, highlights, the "From your notes" tag
  accentSoft:   '#2a2a4a',   // Selected states, accent backgrounds, tag background

  // Status
  success:      '#4ade80',   // Correct answers, mastered topics, streaks
  warning:      '#fbbf24',   // Soon-due deadlines, weak topics
  danger:       '#f87171',   // This-week deadlines, failed topics, "wrong" feedback

  // Text
  textPrimary:  '#f4f4f8',   // Headings and body
  textSecondary:'#9aa0ad',   // Secondary text, timestamps
  textMuted:    '#6b7280',   // Dimmed — placeholders, inactive tabs

  // Tab bar
  tabActive:    '#f4f4f8',
  tabInactive:  '#6b7280',
  tabDot:       '#7c7cf0',
};

export type ColorTokens = typeof lightColors;
```

### Applying themes in components

```tsx
// CORRECT — always use theme tokens
import { useTheme } from '@/hooks/useTheme';

export const NoteCard = () => {
  const colors = useTheme();
  return (
    <View style={{ backgroundColor: colors.bgCard, borderColor: colors.border }}>
      <Text style={{ color: colors.textPrimary }}>Cell Biology Lecture 4</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

// WRONG — never hardcode colors
<View style={{ backgroundColor: '#1e1e2e' }}>
  <Text style={{ color: '#ffffff' }}>Cell Biology Lecture 4</Text>
</View>
```

### NativeWind and theming

NativeWind class names cannot use dynamic theme values. For any view that
needs a theme-aware background, border, or text color: use StyleSheet with
`colors.X` from `useTheme()`.

Use NativeWind only for layout, spacing, and flex that does not change
between themes.

```tsx
// Correct — NativeWind for layout, StyleSheet for colors
<View className="flex-1 px-5 pt-4">
  <View style={[styles.card, { backgroundColor: colors.bgCard }]}>
    <Text style={{ color: colors.textPrimary }}>Content</Text>
  </View>
</View>
```

### Theme toggle in Settings

The Settings screen has a theme toggle. When the user switches theme:

1. Save preference to useThemeStore ('light' | 'dark' | 'system')
1. Persist to AsyncStorage with key 'theme_preference'
1. All screens rerender automatically via useTheme hook

-----

## UI Implementation Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

For any UI-related task:

- Replicate the provided design exactly
- Match pixel-perfect layout, spacing, font sizes, colors, radii, shadows

When a design image is provided you MUST:

- match layout exactly
- match spacing and padding
- match font sizes and hierarchy
- match colors precisely using theme tokens (not hardcoded hex)
- match border radius and shadows
- match alignment and positioning
- replicate all visible UI elements

Do not approximate. Do not simplify unless explicitly asked.

**Polish budget:** the **Ask / Chat** screen (with the "From your notes" tag) and the **Memory Panel** are what win the hackathon. Make these two screens flawless before touching anything else. The **Scan** and **Record** add-note methods are the strongest demo moments — give them real polish too.

-----

## Design System (Official Tokens — Do Not Change Without Approval)

### Typography

Friendly geometric sans — **Inter** or **Plus Jakarta Sans**. One family, 2–3 weights. Load via `@expo-google-fonts/*` and gate the app on `useFonts` before render.

```ts
// constants/typography.ts
export const fonts = {
  regular:  'Inter_400Regular',
  medium:   'Inter_500Medium',
  semibold: 'Inter_600SemiBold',
  bold:     'Inter_700Bold',
};

export const typography = {
  h1:      { fontFamily: 'Inter_700Bold',    fontSize: 32, lineHeight: 38 },
  h2:      { fontFamily: 'Inter_700Bold',    fontSize: 28, lineHeight: 34 },
  h3:      { fontFamily: 'Inter_700Bold',    fontSize: 24, lineHeight: 30 },
  h4:      { fontFamily: 'Inter_600SemiBold',fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 24 },
  bodyLg:  { fontFamily: 'Inter_400Regular', fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 24 },
  bodyMd:  { fontFamily: 'Inter_400Regular', fontSize: 15, lineHeight: 22 },
  bodySm:  { fontFamily: 'Inter_400Regular', fontSize: 13, lineHeight: 20 },
  label:   { fontFamily: 'Inter_500Medium',  fontSize: 12, letterSpacing: 0.4 },
  caption: { fontFamily: 'Inter_500Medium',  fontSize: 11, letterSpacing: 0.4 },
  tab:     { fontFamily: 'Inter_500Medium',  fontSize: 11, letterSpacing: 0.3 },
};
```

### Spacing & Shape

```
Border radius:
  Cards:          16px
  Inner cards:    12px
  Buttons:        12px
  Pills / tags:   999px (fully rounded — the "From your notes" tag)
  Avatars:        50% (fully round)

Base spacing unit: 8px  (use multiples: 8 / 12 / 16 / 24)
Card padding:      16px
Section gap:       12px
Screen padding:    20px horizontal
White space:       generous — let screens breathe

Shadows: soft and subtle — one low-opacity drop shadow, never harsh.

Minimum touch target: 44 × 44pt
```

### Component Patterns

**FromYourNotesTag (the signature component — most important in the app):**

- A small pill below an answer: 📌 icon + "From your notes" + the source note's title
- Background: `accentSoft` · text/icon: `accent` · fully rounded (999px) · tappable → opens `note/[id]`
- Must feel calm, clear, and credible. It is the visible proof of trust.

**SourceBadge (on note cards):**

- PASTED: textMuted border + text
- FILE / PDF: accent border + text
- PHOTO / SCAN: warning border + text
- VOICE: success border + text

**DeadlineCard urgency:**

- THIS WEEK: danger border + text
- SOON:      warning border + text
- LATER:     textMuted border + text

**Quiz feedback:**

- CORRECT: success border + text + subtle success background
- WRONG:   danger (soft) border + text, and reveal the correct answer

**WeakTopicChip:**

- danger for frequently-failed, warning for shaky topics

**Progress / Learning:**

- Progress bar fill: accent · streak flame: success · mastered topic: success

**Empty states (design every one):**

- Chat: "Ask me anything about your notes — I'll only answer from what you've saved."
- Memory: "No notes yet — add your first one!"
- Deadlines: "No deadlines saved — add your first exam date."
- Add Note: "Add your first note — paste it, upload it, snap a photo, or record your class."

## Image Rule

Use centralized image imports.

Before using any image asset:

1. Check if `constants/images.ts` exists
1. If it does not exist, create it
1. Import and export all images from `constants/images.ts`

```ts
// constants/images.ts
import logo from '@/assets/images/logo.png';
import onboarding from '@/assets/images/onboarding.png';

export const images = { logo, onboarding };
```

```tsx
<Image source={images.logo} />
```

Never import image assets directly inside screens or components.

-----

## Styling Rules

Use NativeWind for: layout, flex, spacing, padding, margin, gap, width, height.
Use StyleSheet or inline styles for: colors (always from useTheme), shadows, animations, TextInput, SafeAreaView, KeyboardAvoidingView, Animated.View, platform-specific props.

**Never hardcode hex values.** Always use `colors.X` from `useTheme()`.

```tsx
// Layout with NativeWind, colors with StyleSheet
<View className="flex-1 px-5">
  <View style={{ backgroundColor: colors.bgCard, borderColor: colors.border,
                 borderWidth: 1, borderRadius: 16 }}>
    <Text style={{ ...typography.bodyMd, color: colors.textPrimary }}>
      Content
    </Text>
  </View>
</View>
```

Check the NativeWind version in package.json before using any NativeWind API.
Do not upgrade NativeWind without user approval.

## UI Quality Bar

The app should feel:

- calm, trustworthy, and organized (a study partner that never makes things up)
- polished in both light and dark mode
- friendly and low-anxiety for stressed students
- mobile-first

Use:

- rounded cards
- soft shadows (theme-aware)
- generous white space
- large touch targets (44×44pt minimum)
- readable font sizes (15–16pt minimum body)
- high contrast in both themes
- simple Animated transitions (especially the note "flying into" the Memory Panel)
- friendly empty states

-----

## data/

```
data/
  addMethods.ts        — the four Add Note methods (paste / upload / scan / record)
  onboardingSteps.ts   — static onboarding content (3 steps)
  subjects.ts          — subject tags for notes and quizzes
  promptTemplates.ts   — system prompt templates (grounded chat, quiz gen, OCR cleanup)
```

-----

## store/

```
store/
  useUserStore.ts       — name, what they're studying for, streak, stats
  useNotesStore.ts      — note list + chunks (loaded from SQLite)
  useChatStore.ts       — chat messages, sending state, current citations
  useQuizStore.ts       — current quiz, questions, index, score, weak topics
  useDeadlinesStore.ts  — deadlines, reminder state
  useAddNoteStore.ts    — draft note during the Add flow (method, raw/extracted text, title, subject)
  useSettingsStore.ts   — app preferences (AI model, etc.)
  useThemeStore.ts      — 'light' | 'dark' | 'system', persisted
```

Persist lightweight values with AsyncStorage (profile, settings, theme). Notes, chunks, embeddings, deadlines, and quiz history go to SQLite.

-----

## lib/

```
lib/
  btl.ts             — BTL runtime client init (base URL + scoped API key), OpenAI-compatible
  chat.ts            — grounded chat: retrieve → build context → completion with citations
  embeddings.ts      — embed text via runtime, cosine similarity helper
  retrieval.ts       — chunk notes, store/query vectors, top-K retrieval
  quizgen.ts         — generate flashcards / MCQs from notes (structured JSON)
  ocr.ts             — image → text via a vision model through the gateway
  transcription.ts   — class audio → text (ASR) through the gateway
  files.ts           — extract text from uploaded PDF / doc
  db.ts              — SQLite helpers (never write raw SQL in screens)
  cn.ts              — NativeWind class merge utility
```

The scoped BTL API key lives in an env var (see BTL Runtime Rules) and is read **only** inside `lib/btl.ts`. No other file references it. Never commit the key.

-----

## State Management Rules

- Zustand: all global client state
- Local useState: temporary UI state (modal open, loading, flashcard flipped, etc.)
- AsyncStorage: lightweight persistence (profile, settings, theme)
- SQLite: notes, chunks/embeddings, deadlines, quiz history

-----

## TypeScript Rules

Use TypeScript strictly. Avoid `any`. Keep types simple.

```ts
// types/note.ts
export type NoteSource = 'paste' | 'file' | 'scan' | 'voice';

export type Note = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subject: string | null;
  content: string;
  source: NoteSource;
  createdAt: string;
};

export type NoteChunk = {
  id: string;
  noteId: string;
  text: string;
  embedding: number[];   // JSON float array, for cosine similarity retrieval
};

// types/chat.ts
export type Role = 'user' | 'assistant';

export type Citation = {
  noteId: string;
  noteTitle: string;
  snippet: string;
};

export type ChatMessage = {
  id: string;
  role: Role;
  content: string;
  grounded: boolean;          // true only when backed by retrieved notes
  citations: Citation[];      // shown as "📌 From your notes" tags
  createdAt: string;
};

// types/quiz.ts
export type QuizFormat = 'flashcard' | 'mcq';

export type QuizQuestion = {
  id: string;
  format: QuizFormat;
  prompt: string;
  answer: string;
  options?: string[];         // MCQ only
  sourceNoteId: string;
  sourceNoteTitle: string;
};

export type QuizResult = {
  total: number;
  correct: number;
  weakTopics: string[];       // subjects/topics to review
  questions: QuizQuestion[];
};

// types/deadline.ts
export type Urgency = 'thisWeek' | 'soon' | 'later';

export type Deadline = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subject: string | null;
  dueDate: string;
  reminderOn: boolean;
  urgency: Urgency;           // derived from dueDate
};

// types/user.ts
export type UserProfile = {
  name: string;
  studyingFor: string;        // course or exam
  streak: number;
  createdAt: string;
};

// types/theme.ts
export type ThemePreference = 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
export type ColorTokens = typeof import('@/constants/colors').lightColors;
```

## Feature Implementation Rules

When the user asks to build a feature:

1. Read this file first
1. Identify files to change
1. Plan component breakdown before writing code
1. Keep changes focused
1. Follow existing patterns
1. Ensure feature works end-to-end
1. Fix errors before finishing

### Build Roadmap & Progress (living checklist — keep it current)

This is the **process to follow**. Work top-to-bottom, one phase at a time. When a phase is done and
tested, flip its box to `[x]` and add a one-line note. **Do not start the next phase if the current one
is broken.** The "BTL endpoint" column is the rubric lever (30 pts + tie-breaker #1) — most remaining
value is wiring real BTL calls behind the UI that already exists.

> **Current focus: Phase 6 — Quiz flow** (then Phase 7 Deadlines).
> Phases 0–5 are done: UI shell, BTL client, SQLite persistence, lexical retrieval, the
> grounded Ask ★ chat, and the Dashboard/Profile now read real data from the user + notes stores.

|  | Phase | What it delivers | BTL endpoint | Status |
|--|-------|------------------|--------------|--------|
|✅| 0 · UI shell + design system | Onboarding, tabs (home/ask/memory/quiz/profile), add flows, deadlines, note, quiz, settings — all screens + components + light theme | — | **Done** (mock data) |
|✅| 1 · BTL client foundation | `lib/btl.ts` (env-scoped OpenAI-compatible client) + proven live calls + friendly error path | chat | **Done** |
|✅| 2 · Persistence | `lib/db.ts` (SQLite) + `store/use-notes-store.ts` + `lib/note-view.ts`; Add-Paste/Upload/Edit/onboarding save real notes; Memory Panel + Note Details + Reader read them; delete works | — | **Done** |
|✅| 3 · Retrieval foundation | `lib/retrieval.ts` chunk + rank; lexical scoring (catalog has no embedding model) | — (lexical) | **Done** |
|✅| 4 · Ask / Chat ★ + "From your notes" | Grounded RAG: retrieve → **stream** answer → citations; honest empty-note fallback + "Add a note" CTA | chat (stream) | **Done** |
|✅| 5 · Dashboard real data | `store/use-user-store.ts` (profile · streak · AI-answer count) + `hooks/use-dashboard.ts` / `use-profile.ts`; Home + Profile read real notes/user stores; honest empty states for deadlines + weak topics (their stores land in 6/7) | — | **Done** |
|⬜| 6 · Quiz flow ← **now** | Generate flashcards / MCQs from note chunks; scoring; weak topics | chat (JSON) | Not started |
|⬜| 7 · Deadlines | Real deadlines + `expo-notifications` reminders + urgency colours | — | Not started |
|⬜| 8 · Add Note advanced | Upload (extract) · Scan (vision OCR) · Record (audio transcription) | vision · audio | Not started |
|⬜| 9 · Settings + polish + submission | Model picker, empty states, animations, README with BTL endpoints used, 2-min demo video | — | Not started |

**BTL endpoints used so far (submission field):** `chat/completions` — non-stream (note summary, PDF extract) **and** stream (grounded Ask ★).

_Phase 4 done: `types/chat.ts`, `lib/chat.ts` (grounded RAG orchestrator), `store/use-chat-store.ts`, and `btlChatStream` in `lib/btl.ts` (SSE via `expo/fetch`) added; Ask screen streams answers from saved notes, tags each with "From your notes", and shows an honest fallback + "Add a note" CTA when retrieval finds nothing. Streaming shape verified live against `btl-2` (7 deltas, standard `choices[0].delta.content`). lint + typecheck green._

_Phase 5 done: `types/user.ts`, `lib/study-stats.ts` (pure streak + semester math, unit-tested), `store/use-user-store.ts` (AsyncStorage), `hooks/use-dashboard.ts` + `hooks/use-profile.ts` added. Onboarding About now saves name/course/goal; `_layout` loads the profile and advances the day-streak once per calendar day; grounded Ask ★ answers increment a persisted "AI Answers" count. Home shows live Notes count + AI Answers + streak + semester progress (derived from account age) and honest empty states (deadlines, weak topics) that route to Add Deadline / Quiz; Profile mirrors the same real stats. Quiz Score is an honest "—" until Phase 6. lint + typecheck green; streak/semester helpers pass 16/16 assertions._

**Next (Phase 6 — Quiz flow):** generate flashcards / MCQs from note chunks via BTL (JSON), score them, and surface weak topics — which then fill the Dashboard's weak-topics preview and the Quiz Score stat that Phase 5 left as placeholders.

-----

## BTL Runtime Rules (CRITICAL)

All AI in the app goes through the **BTL Runtime** — Bad Theory Labs' OpenAI-compatible gateway. This is a hackathon requirement: **every submission must call the BTL runtime.** Never call another LLM provider directly; route everything through the gateway.

### Verified runtime facts (from https://runtime.badtheorylabs.com/docs — checked 2026-07-04)

- **Base URL:** `https://api.badtheorylabs.com/v1` (env `EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_BASE_URL`). It is an OpenAI-compatible drop-in — the `openai` JS client with the base URL swapped works.
- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (env `EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_API_KEY`).
- **Chat:** `/chat/completions` **or** `/responses` (both OpenAI-compatible), streaming supported. The dashboard's confirmed default model is **`btl-2`** — use it as `CHAT_MODEL`. A large aliased catalog also exists (300+ slugs at `/models`, e.g. `gpt-4.1-mini`, `claude-haiku-4-5`, `gemini-2.5-flash`); expose the choice in Settings later. Main rule from the dashboard: *every project must call the BTL runtime.*
- **Vision (scan OCR):** vision-capable chat models exist (`qwen3-vl-*`, `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, `llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct`). OCR = send the image to a vision chat model; there is **no** separate OCR endpoint.
- **Audio (record transcription):** `gpt-audio` / `gpt-audio-mini` are listed — confirm the transcription request shape before relying on it, and keep a manual-edit transcript fallback.
- **Embeddings ⚠️:** the catalog did **not** surface a dedicated text-embedding model. Verify one exists before building vector retrieval. **If none, ground retrieval lexically** (keyword/overlap scoring over note chunks) — the trust promise is preserved by the retrieval GATE + citations, not by vectors specifically. Never drop the grounding gate.
- Response headers expose economics (`x-btl-request-id`, `x-btl-customer-charge`, `x-btl-saved`) — useful for the demo/README.
- **⚠️ Credit budget: only ~$0.50 of runtime credits for the ENTIRE build + demo.** Study the docs to get request shapes right *before* spending a call; never spray test calls; use the cheapest model + short `max_tokens` when a test is unavoidable; cache/persist results in SQLite so nothing is embedded or answered twice.

> The `CHAT_MODEL` / `EMBED_MODEL` names in the example below are placeholders — update them to what the catalog actually offers.

### Client setup

Store the scoped API key and base URL in env (`.env`, git-ignored). Read them **only** in `lib/btl.ts`.

```ts
// lib/btl.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';

export const btl = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_API_KEY,          // scoped hackathon key — never commit
  baseURL: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_BASE_URL,        // e.g. https://api.badtheorylabs.com/v1
});

// Models are selectable in Settings and read from useSettingsStore.model.
export const CHAT_MODEL = 'gpt-4o-mini';    // any provider behind the BTL gateway
export const EMBED_MODEL = 'text-embedding-3-small';
```

> **Key-security note:** a client-embedded key is only acceptable because the hackathon issues a
> *scoped* key with limited free credits. If time allows, put a one-route proxy in front so the key
> never ships in the app. Either way, the key is referenced in exactly one file.

### Grounded chat (the star feature)

Answers must come **only** from the student's retrieved notes. Retrieve first, then generate with the retrieved chunks as the sole context, and return the citations.

```ts
// lib/chat.ts
import { btl, CHAT_MODEL } from './btl';
import { retrieveTopK } from './retrieval';

export const askFromNotes = async (question: string) => {
  const hits = await retrieveTopK(question, 4);      // top-K note chunks by cosine similarity

  if (hits.length === 0) {
    return { grounded: false, content: "I don't have that in your notes yet.", citations: [] };
  }

  const context = hits.map((h, i) => `[${i + 1}] (${h.noteTitle})\n${h.text}`).join('\n\n');

  const res = await btl.chat.completions.create({
    model: CHAT_MODEL,
    stream: true,
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content:
          'You are AI University Companion. Answer ONLY using the provided notes. ' +
          'If the notes do not contain the answer, say "I don\'t have that in your notes yet." ' +
          'Never use outside knowledge. Never invent facts. Cite the note numbers you used.',
      },
      { role: 'user', content: `Notes:\n${context}\n\nQuestion: ${question}` },
    ],
  });

  return { grounded: true, stream: res, citations: hits };   // citations → "📌 From your notes" tags
};
```

### BTL Rules Summary

- Every AI call goes through the BTL runtime. No direct third-party provider calls.
- Use OpenAI-compatible endpoints: `/v1/chat/completions` (chat, quiz gen, OCR cleanup),
  embeddings for retrieval, and audio/vision models for transcription and scan — all via the gateway.
- Use `stream: true` for chat so answers feel fast.
- The scoped API key is read only in `lib/btl.ts`, from an env var, and is never committed or logged.
- Chat, quiz, OCR, and transcription models are user-selectable in Settings → AI Model.
- Show a friendly error if the runtime is unreachable or credits are exhausted — never a raw stack trace.

-----

## Retrieval & Grounding Rules (RAG — the trust engine)

The promise "answers only from your notes" is delivered by retrieval, not by hoping the model behaves. This is the app's core loop.

Flow:

1. On save, split a note into small overlapping chunks (`lib/retrieval.ts`)
1. Embed each chunk via the BTL runtime (`lib/embeddings.ts`) and store the vector in SQLite
1. On a question, embed the query and rank chunks by cosine similarity — take top-K
1. If **no chunk clears the similarity threshold**, do **not** call the model — return the honest fallback: *"I don't have that in your notes yet."* with an "Add a note" action
1. Otherwise pass only the retrieved chunks as context and generate the answer
1. Return the source notes as `citations` → rendered as "📌 From your notes: <title>" tags, each tappable to open the note

Implementation rules:

- Retrieval is the gate. An answer is only shown as grounded when real chunks backed it.
- Quiz questions are generated from retrieved note chunks too — every question carries its `sourceNoteId`.
- Keep chunks small (a few sentences) with light overlap so citations point to a precise place.
- Never let the model answer from general knowledge. The system prompt forbids it *and* retrieval enforces it.
- Store embeddings locally (SQLite) so retrieval is instant and works offline for already-saved notes.

-----

## Database Rules

Use `expo-sqlite` only for structured local data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes (
  id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title      TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject    TEXT,
  content    TEXT NOT NULL,
  source     TEXT NOT NULL,   -- "paste" | "file" | "scan" | "voice"
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS note_chunks (
  id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  note_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
  text       TEXT NOT NULL,
  embedding  TEXT NOT NULL,   -- JSON float array for cosine similarity
  FOREIGN KEY (note_id) REFERENCES notes(id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS deadlines (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title       TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject     TEXT,
  due_date    TEXT NOT NULL,
  reminder_on INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0   -- 0 | 1
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quiz_results (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at  TEXT NOT NULL,
  total       INTEGER NOT NULL,
  correct     INTEGER NOT NULL,
  weak_topics TEXT              -- JSON array of topic strings
);
```

All DB calls go through `lib/db.ts`. No raw SQL in screens or components.

-----

## Linting and Validation

Run after every feature:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Fix all errors before considering a feature complete.

-----

## Communication Style

Be concise. Explain what changed and how to test.

When a phase is complete state clearly:

> "Phase [N] is complete. Here is how to test it: …"

-----

## Important Constraints

- All AI must go through the **BTL runtime** (hackathon requirement) — no direct third-party provider calls
- The scoped API key is read only in `lib/btl.ts`, from an env var, and is never committed or logged
- No answer may come from outside the student's saved notes (retrieval-gated grounding)
- No separate auth service (Clerk, Firebase, etc.) for the hackathon build
- No analytics or crash reporting that ships note content off device

Use:

- SQLite for notes, chunks/embeddings, deadlines, and quiz history
- AsyncStorage for profile, settings, and theme preference
- Zustand for app state
- BTL runtime for all AI (chat, embeddings, retrieval, OCR, transcription)

-----

## Trust & Grounding Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

AI University Companion promises it **only answers from the student's own notes and never invents anything**. This is the emotional core of the product — protect it in every feature.

- Never answer a question that retrieval could not ground in a saved note. Show the honest fallback instead.
- Every grounded answer must display its source via the "📌 From your notes" tag.
- Never let the model use outside/general knowledge to fill gaps.
- Note content **is** sent to the BTL runtime to be embedded, retrieved, and answered — be honest about this in copy. Notes are stored locally as the source of truth; only what's needed is sent to the runtime. (This app is cloud-AI via BTL, unlike a fully on-device build.)
- Never log note content or the API key to any external service.

If a feature would let the app answer without a grounding note, stop and ask:

> "This would let the app answer from outside the student's notes, which breaks the trust promise. Can we gate it behind retrieval and show a citation instead?"

-----

## Final Reminder

Before every feature implementation:

- Read this file
- Follow it strictly
- Plan component breakdown before writing any code
- Screen files max 150 lines. Component files max 200 lines.
- Never hardcode hex colors — always use `colors.X` from `useTheme()`
- Replicate UI exactly when designs are provided — match both light and dark modes
- Route all AI through the BTL runtime, and never show an answer that retrieval could not ground in a real note
