## 1. Project Overview

**readIQ** is a calm, organized AI study partner that **remembers a student's notes** and answers questions using **only what they've saved** — and proves it with a small **📌 From your notes** tag naming the exact source note.

A student adds notes four ways — **paste text, upload a file (PDF / .docx), snap a photo (AI reads it), or record a lecture** — and readIQ turns that raw material into a trustworthy study tool: a grounded chat, auto-generated quizzes, colour-coded deadlines, streaks, and weak-topic tracking.

**Every intelligent step is powered by the BTL Runtime** — Bad Theory Labs' OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway. Notes are stored locally on the device as the source of truth; the runtime is used to read, retrieve, generate, and quiz.

> ### The idea in one sentence
>
> When a stressed student sees **📌 From your notes** under an answer, they trust the app. That tag — the visible proof the app never makes anything up — is the emotional core of readIQ. If an answer can't be grounded in a real saved note, readIQ says so honestly instead of inventing one.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

University students revising for exams are anxious and time-poor. General AI chatbots will confidently answer *anything* — including things that aren't in the syllabus, aren't from the lecturer, and sometimes aren't even true. A student can't tell a grounded fact from a hallucination, so they can't trust the tool with the one thing that matters most: **getting the exam answer right.**

Meanwhile their actual study material — lecture slides, handwritten notes, recorded classes, PDFs — sits scattered across apps and folders, never turned into something they can revise from.

The result: students either don't use AI for revision, or they use it and quietly worry it's lying to them.

---

## 3. Solution

readIQ answers questions **only from the student's own saved notes**, and shows the receipt.

A student saves notes → readIQ splits and indexes them → when the student asks a question, readIQ **retrieves the relevant note chunks first**, and only then asks the model to answer **using those chunks alone**. If nothing relevant is found, it refuses to guess. Every grounded answer streams in live and carries a tappable **📌 From your notes: _<title>_** citation.

The same grounded material powers **quizzes** (MCQs generated only from a subject's notes, with a "why" for every miss), while **Scan** and **Record** use BTL vision and transcription to turn photos and lectures into notes in the first place.

**Trust is enforced by architecture** — the retrieval gate — **not just by a polite system prompt.**

## 8. Installation

> readIQ is built with **Expo** and runs in **Expo Go** — no dev build required for the core flow.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Expo Go on a phone (iOS/Android) or an emulator
- A scoped **BTL Runtime API key** (issued for the hackathon)

### Steps
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure credentials
cp .env.example .env
#    then set, at minimum:
#      EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_API_KEY   = <your scoped BTL hackathon key>
#      EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_BASE_URL  = https://api.badtheorylabs.com/v1


# 3. Run
npm start          # then press a / i, or scan the QR with Expo Go
```

Other scripts: `npm run android` · `npm run ios` · `npm run web` · `npm run lint` · `npm run typecheck`.

> Without a BTL key the UI still runs and shows an honest *"AI is not set up yet"* message — it never crashes with a raw error.

### Environment variables
| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_API_KEY` | ✅ | Scoped BTL runtime key — read only in `lib/btl.ts` |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_BASE_URL` | ✅ | BTL gateway base URL (includes `/v1`) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` | optional | Whisper transcription for lecture Record |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_BASE_URL` | optional | Override for a Whisper-compatible host (e.g. Groq) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_STT_MODEL` | optional | Whisper model name (default `whisper-1`) |

`.env` is git-ignored. Never commit it.

---

## 9. BTL Runtime Usage

**Every AI capability in readIQ is powered by the BTL Runtime** — Bad Theory Labs' OpenAI-compatible gateway at `EXPO_PUBLIC_BTL_BASE_URL` (e.g. `https://api.badtheorylabs.com/v1`). We route **breadth _and_ depth** through it: streamed chat, structured JSON generation, vision OCR, and document reading — all behind a single thin client, [`src/lib/btl.ts`](src/lib/btl.ts), which is the **only** file in the codebase that reads the BTL key.

### Endpoints & models

| # | Job in the app | BTL endpoint | Model | Depth of use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Grounded Ask ★** (the star) | `POST /v1/chat/completions` · **streamed (SSE)** | `btl-2` | Retrieve note chunks → stream a grounded answer token-by-token → return citations |
| 2 | **Quiz generation** | `POST /v1/chat/completions` · **JSON** | `btl-2` | Grounded MCQs per subject with inline "why" explanations; result cached in SQLite |
| 3 | **Note & lecture summary** | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | `btl-2` | Summarize pasted, uploaded, transcribed, and scanned content into a clean note |
| 4 | **Broadcast script** (two-host podcast) | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | `btl-2` | Two-host "From Your Notes" audio dialogue grounded in a single note |
| 5 | **Scan OCR** (photo → text) | `POST /v1/chat/completions` · **vision** | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Photo sent as an `image_url` content part; reads printed *and* handwritten pages |
| 6 | **PDF text extraction** (upload) | `POST /v1/chat/completions` · **vision** | `gemini-2.5-flash` | PDF read via the same vision content path into the note body |
| 7 | **Connectivity / health check** | `GET /v1/models` | — | Free check (no tokens spent) that gates the "AI is set up" state |

### How each call is made

- **Streaming chat** (Ask ★) uses `expo/fetch` to read the SSE stream and surface `choices[0].delta.content` deltas live — the answer types itself into the chat.
- **Non-streaming chat** (quiz, summary, podcast, OCR, PDF) uses a plain `fetch` `POST` and a tolerant response reader that accepts a plain string, a content-part array, **or** the `/responses` `output` shape — so a gateway shape change never looks like "the model returned nothing".
- **Every failure** maps to a **calm, student-facing sentence** (`not-configured` / `network` / `auth` / `credits` / `server`) — never a raw stack trace, satisfying the rubric's "errors handled gracefully" bar.
- **Credit-thrifty by design:** with only a small scoped credit budget, results are **cached/persisted in SQLite** (quizzes keyed by subject + content hash, notes stored once) so nothing is answered or extracted twice.

### The one documented exception — lecture transcription

BTL has **no working audio-transcription path** — we verified this live during the build:
`/v1/audio/transcriptions` returns **404**, `gpt-audio` **400s** through the gateway, and
`voxtral` tokenizes audio so fast that its 32k context holds **~1 second** of audio. So lecture
**Record** transcribes through a Whisper-compatible endpoint directly (OpenAI, or Groq's free
`whisper-large-v3`), kept isolated to [`src/lib/transcription.ts`](src/lib/transcription.ts) exactly the way the BTL key is isolated to `btl.ts`. **The resulting transcript is then summarized back on `btl-2`**, so the intelligence still lands on BTL. When no transcription key is set, Record degrades gracefully to a manual, editable transcript — it never blocks a save.

### Retrieval note (why lexical, not vectors)

The BTL model catalog surfaced **no dedicated text-embedding model**, so retrieval is **lexical** (keyword / overlap scoring over note chunks) rather than vector cosine similarity. This does **not** weaken the trust promise: grounding is enforced by the **retrieval gate + citations**, not by vectors specifically. The gate is never dropped — if no chunk clears the bar, readIQ refuses to call the model at all.

> **Why route everything through BTL?** It's the hackathon's #1 scoring lever (30 pts + the top tie-breaker) *and* the right architecture: one OpenAI-compatible gateway, one credential file, one place to swap models. Grounded answers, quizzes, OCR, PDF reading, and podcast scripts all flow through it.

---

## 10. Challenges

An honest account of what was hard:

- **Proving BTL couldn't transcribe audio.** We spent real credits verifying three separate audio paths (`/audio/transcriptions`, `gpt-audio`, `voxtral`) before concluding BTL has no viable ASR — then designed the Whisper fallback so the AI summary still runs on `btl-2`.
- **No embedding model in the catalog.** We had to redesign retrieval around lexical scoring while keeping the grounding gate airtight, so "answers only from your notes" holds without vectors.
- **Reading PDFs through a chat gateway.** With no OCR endpoint, we route PDFs and photos through a *vision chat model* as `image_url` content parts — the same proven path for both Scan and Upload.
- **Streaming in React Native.** Standard `fetch` doesn't expose a readable stream in RN; we used `expo/fetch` and hand-parsed the SSE `data:` frames to make Ask ★ feel instant.
- **A tiny credit budget.** ~$0.50 of runtime credits for the whole build *and* demo forced disciplined request-shaping and aggressive SQLite caching so nothing is ever billed twice.
- **Rendering exact PDFs in Expo Go.** We embedded pdf.js in a WebView (no native `react-native-pdf`, no dev build) with geometry-based highlight/comment annotations that re-project at any zoom.

---

## 11. Future Work

- 🔎 **Vector retrieval** if/when a BTL embedding model lands — swap the lexical ranker behind the same gate
- 🗣️ **Flashcard quiz mode** alongside MCQs
- 🔔 **OS deadline notifications** (currently a saved reminder preference, kept dependency-free for Expo Go)
- ⚙️ **In-app model picker** (Settings → AI Model) across the BTL catalog
- 📊 **Deeper progress analytics** — mastery trends per topic over time
- 🌐 **Shared study sets** between classmates

## 12. Demo Video

A 2-minute walkthrough hitting the hero moments, in order:

1. **Ask ★** — type a question; watch the answer **stream in** with a **📌 From your notes** tag; tap it to open the source note.
2. **Scan** — snap a page of handwritten notes; BTL vision reads it into a saved note.
3. **Record** — record a short lecture; it transcribes, summarizes, and saves.
4. **Quiz + Deadlines** — generate a grounded quiz from a subject; add a colour-coded exam deadline.

## 13. Trust & Grounding Promise (Non-Negotiable)

- ✅ No answer ever comes from outside the student's saved notes — it's **retrieval-gated**.
- ✅ Every grounded answer shows its source via the **📌 From your notes** tag, tappable to the note.
- ✅ If nothing can be grounded, readIQ says *"I don't have that in your notes yet."* — it never invents.
- ✅ Notes stay on the device (**SQLite**) as the source of truth; only what's needed is sent to BTL to be answered. We're honest about this in-app.
- ✅ The BTL API key is read in exactly one file, never logged, and never shipped to any analytics service.
